# web/gate — the diff gate where Python cannot run

The instrument is `styxx/diffgate.py`. Two browser surfaces cannot import it: the paste-in
preview page and the bookmarklet. They run `diffgate.js`, a JavaScript transliteration of one
specific file — `styxx/diffgate.py` as it stands on `main` (BC-2 + COMPAT-1 + BIN-2 + COMPAT-2,
pull requests #113, #115, #120 and #124, plus the `fetch_pr` door; the file **7.48.0** ships),
sha256 `473a7dd7c2dce7b1fefd07eaba27291090dd351a0c108b28f4812c7dc77f536d` (LF line endings; a wheel
built on Windows carries CRLF and hashes differently, so `py_side.py` normalises before it
compares) — and this directory is the receipt for that port: the differential test that holds
it to the Python's output, and the build that turns it into the bookmarklet people drag into
their bookmarks bar.

The port was first cut from the 7.47.0 wheel (`fb2d9b3e…`) and re-cut on 2026-09-16 for issue
#110: the 7.47.0 templates count Python `def` lines and accuse a TypeScript commit that says
"added 2 tests" of lying, and the bookmarklet is a public door, so it moved to the repaired file
ahead of the release rather than after it. What changed between the two files is listed in the
header of `diffgate.js` and measured below under *Drift*.

(The `/gate` page on the site is different: it runs the real released Python under CPython 3.13
via Pyodide, with the two module files hashed in the browser against the wheel. No port there.)

## What is here

`diffgate.js` — `gateDiffText(summary, diff, {strict})`, `parseUnifiedDiff(text)` and
`parseUnifiedDiffSides(text)`, the same closed template set (eleven templates, `compat_claim`
included), the same verdict strings, the same `why` text, the same `detail` — including the
`removed` list the compatibility reading attaches, and Python's `repr()` quoting where the
Python builds a reason with `!r`. Two deliberate gaps, both
stated in the file: the structural "unparsed claims" observer (`styxx.claimdetect`) is not
ported, and `--run` / `--evidence` do not exist, so "tests pass" is always UNCHECKABLE, exactly
as the CLI without `--run`.

`bookmarklet_ui.js` — the panel: on a `github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/N` page it reads the
description and the diff from `api.github.com` (two unauthenticated requests, nothing else,
nothing stored, nothing sent anywhere) and pins `[ok ]` / `[LIE]` / `[ ? ]` lines, the verdict
and the never-read count to the page.

`build_bookmarklet.py` — assembles the two into `bookmarklet_src.js`, minifies with
`terser -c -m --format ascii_only`, writes `bookmarklet.min.js` and `bookmarklet.href.txt`.
`--check` rebuilds and compares against the committed files. The shipped bookmarklet is

    bookmarklet.min.js    sha256 df0c801605f0bb995e10be43b75e3ca3cd77113e6487496401988a23ff5596d8   20,696 chars
    bookmarklet.href.txt  sha256 189ad32e349cad08bd6dcb971a4faa2325d7ef519857cad9bc84f7f2c79364dc   20,707 chars

(Earlier builds: `b04d14dc…`, 11,437 chars, from the 7.47.0 file — accuses outside Python;
`9ea8f572…`, 17,686 chars, the BC-2 + COMPAT-1 re-cut — cannot see a binary file. A bookmark
that hashes to either is an old port; drag the new one.)

Whatever a browser holds under that bookmark either hashes to the first line (drop the
`javascript:` prefix) or is not this build. terser 5.51.2 produced these bytes.

`differential/` — the test. Read on.

## The differential test

A port is held to the original by output, not by trust. `differential/` builds a corpus of
(summary, diff) pairs, runs the released Python and the JavaScript over every pair, and compares
the records field by field: verdict, measured, why_unmeasured, sentences_total,
uncovered_sentences, the never-read list in order, and every claim as
(kind, verdict, why, text, detail) in order. A port that gets the verdict right for the wrong
reason, or reads one sentence more or less, is a disagreement.

    cd web/gate/differential             # on a checkout carrying #113 and #115 (or 7.48.0)
    python build_corpus.py               # 176 real pairs, pinned to shas (below)
    python fuzz_corpus.py                # 3,000 synthetic pairs, seeded
    python py_side.py                    # refuses to run unless styxx/diffgate.py hashes to 473a7dd7…
    node js_side.js
    python differential.py
    node check_pairs.js                  # the 36 pinned pairs against their expect blocks

The pin moved twice between the last two runs of this differential, and one of those moves is a
finding rather than a routine bump. COMPAT-2 (#124) changed the compat reading and the port had to
follow it — that is ordinary. But #124 merged with only its Python half, and separately the
`fetch_pr` door landed on `main` after the previous pin was written, so `py_side.py` had been
**refusing to run on `main`** ever since: the check that guards the two-implementation claim was
itself disabled, which is exactly how the port was able to fall a whole cycle behind without
anything failing. `fetch_pr` fetches a pull request over the network and is no part of the reading
the port transliterates; it moves this whole-file hash without changing a single verdict. Both
facts are recorded here rather than quietly corrected.

Result, 2026-09-18, `main` at the COMPAT-2 reading:

    3212 pairs, 6921 claims (600 verified, 1612 contradicted, 4709 uncheckable) — 0 disagreement(s)

The 3,212 are the 3,176 below plus 36 pinned pairs committed as JSON (the `.gitignore` here
ignores generated JSON and names these four as exceptions): `bc1_pairs.json`, the four pairs BC-2
owes the differential (a TypeScript commit saying "Added 2 tests", "adds a method to reload",
"only modifies the footer", two prefixes), also checked on the Python side by
`tests/test_diffgate_bc1.py`; and `compat_pairs.json`, nineteen more — the compatibility
reading in every branch (Python, JS/TS, Go, Rust, Java and Kotlin, a moved definition, no
covered language, more than five names, all nine phrases, an empty diff), the V14 bare-name and
containment cases, "added 3 test cases", second prefixes that are and are not path-shaped, a
changed path with an apostrophe (Python's `repr()` switches to double quotes; so does the port),
and the demo diff with CRLF line endings; and `bin1_pairs.json`, six for the #118 repair — a
binary beside a text file, three binaries added / modified / deleted, a pure rename and a mode
change, a file count that is true only once the binaries are seen, an `only_touches` lie hidden
behind a binary, a quoted path — also checked on the Python side by `tests/test_diffgate_bin1.py`;
and `compat2_pairs.json`, seven for the COMPAT-2 reading — a surface drop beside a scaffolding drop
and a signature change, scaffolding-only removals, a move with the same parameters, a Go signature
re-flowed over two lines, an exported arrow function's parameters, Java's name-then-paren regex,
seven surface drops beside one under `internal/`. Their `expect` blocks are the Python's output,
written down so a reader can see the intended readings without running anything. The 3,199
pre-BIN-2 records were byte-identical before and after that repair (G-BIN-2); of the 3,205
pre-COMPAT-2 records, 3,196 are byte-identical after it and 9 differ only in `compat_claim`
reasons and details (17 claims), which is COMPAT-2's G-C2-4.

The first result, the 7.47.0 port against the 7.47.0 file, was 3176 pairs, 8904 claims
(1024 verified, 2172 contradicted, 5708 uncheckable), 0 disagreements; that port is in this
directory's history.

The corpus is pinned so it is the same bytes everywhere: the 160 commits reachable from
`fa8bcde725252dd6264d89045fa58fce7f3d9e51` (each message against its own diff), three
pull-request descriptions written that day (`bodies/pr94.md`, `pr95.md`, `pr98.md`, each against
its branch head at the time — shas in `build_corpus.py`), the README demo, twelve edge cases from
the test suite, and 3,000 fuzzed pairs from `random.seed(20260916)`. The fuzzer aims at the
template set's soft spots on purpose (quoted and bare paths, Node.js-style non-file nouns,
"the same way x.py was", bullets, counts of zero, empty diffs, text that is not a diff), because a
port that agrees on easy input proves little. The figure posted the same day, 3,177 pairs, had one
more pair: an external project's PR description, left out of the committed corpus because it is
not ours to republish. It carried zero diff-shaped claims, so the claim count is the same 8,904.

## Drift: the port is ahead of the release

Until 7.48.0 ships, `pip install styxx` gives the 7.47.0 file and the port does not match it.
`python py_side.py --installed` runs the installed package instead of the checkout and is
expected to disagree. Measured the same day, port against the 7.47.0 wheel:

    3199 pairs, 8932 claims (1031 verified, 2189 contradicted, 5712 uncheckable) — 5448 disagreement(s)

What moved, on the 3,176 corpus pairs (the pinned pairs were written for the new file and are
left out of these counts; the #118 repair changes none of the 3,176 records, and COMPAT-2 changes
only `compat_claim` reasons, a kind the wheel never reads, so the figures below are unchanged by
either): the wheel makes 573 accusations the port does not — `symbol_added`
219, `only_touches` 205, `tests_added` 149 — and the port makes none the wheel does not. 286
pairs flip from FAIL to PASS and none flip the other way. The port reads 2,044 fewer
`file_touched` claims (the V14 repairs declining bare and ambiguous path mentions) and one more
sentence kind, `compat_claim`, which the wheel never reads (one sentence in this corpus carries
it). Every one of the 573 now ends in a reason citing #110 — 368 "no Python file in the diff;
this template counts `def` lines", 205 "prefix '…' is not a path" — because every one was an
accusation the issue showed to be unsupported by construction. On the EXTERNAL-1 corpus the same repair withdrew 569 of
665 (`papers/closed-model-frontier/RESULT_bc2_by_construction_lands_2026_09_16.md`).

When 7.48.0 is on PyPI, `py_side.py --installed` should print 0 disagreements against it; if it
does not, the release is not the file the port claims to be, and the header of `diffgate.js`
says which one it is.

## What this is not

It is not a second instrument. The Python is the instrument; the JavaScript exists only where the
Python cannot run, and the day the two disagree on a pair in this corpus, the JavaScript is wrong
by definition. It is not a check of anything but transliteration fidelity — the template set's
own precision was measured elsewhere (EXTERNAL-1: path accusations at 0.23 against a 0.95 floor
on 71,016 agent-authored PRs, and withheld since), and no number here bears on that.
